## What is React context?

React context allows us to pass down and use (consume) data in whatever component we need in our React app without using props.

In other words, React context allows us to share data (state) across our components more easily.

## When should you use React context?

React context is great when you are passing data that can be used in any component in your application


These types of data include:

* Theme data (like dark or light mode)
* User data (the currently authenticated user)
* Location-specific data (like user language or locale)

## What problems does React context solve?

React context helps us avoid the problem of props drilling.

Props drilling is a term to describe when you pass props down multiple levels to a nested component, through components that don't need it.

Here is an example of props drilling. In this application, we have access to theme data that we want to pass as a prop to all of our app's components.

As you can see, however, the direct children of App, such as Header, also have to pass the theme data down using props.


>export default function App({ theme }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Header theme={theme} />
      <Main theme={theme} />
      <Sidebar theme={theme} />
      <Footer theme={theme} />
    </>
  );
}

>function Header({ theme }) {
  return (
    <>
      <User theme={theme} />
      <Login theme={theme} />
      <Menu theme={theme} />
    </>
  );
}

## What is the issue with this example?

The issue is that we are drilling the theme prop through multiple components that don't immediately need it.

The Header component doesn't need theme other than to pass it down to its child component. In other words, it would be better for User , Login and Menu to consume the theme data directly.

This is the benefit of React context â€“ we can bypass using props entirely and therefore avoid the issue of props drilling.
