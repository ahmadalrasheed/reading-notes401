# Django Tutorial Part 9: Working with forms
## Overview
An HTML Form is a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page, which can be used to collect information from users for submission to a server. Forms are a flexible mechanism for collecting user input because there are suitable widgets for entering many different types of data, including text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers and so on. Forms are also a relatively secure way of sharing data with the server, as they allow us to send data in POST requests with cross-site request forgery protection.

While we haven't created any forms in this tutorial so far, we've already encountered them in the Django Admin site â€” for example, the screenshot below shows a form for editing one of our Book models, comprised of a number of selection lists and text editors.

Working with forms can be complicated! Developers need to write HTML for the form, validate and properly sanitize entered data on the server (and possibly also in the browser), repost the form with error messages to inform users of any invalid fields, handle the data when it has successfully been submitted, and finally respond to the user in some way to indicate success. Django Forms take a lot of the work out of all these steps, by providing a framework that lets you define forms and their fields programmatically, and then use these objects to both generate the form HTML code and handle much of the validation and user interaction.


## HTML Forms
First a brief overview of HTML Forms. Consider a simple HTML form, with a single text field for entering the name of some "team", and its associated label:

The form is defined in HTML as a collection of elements inside <form>...</form> tags, containing at least one input element of type="submit".

```
<form action="/team_name_url/" method="post">
    <label for="team_name">Enter name: </label>
    <input id="team_name" type="text" name="name_field" value="Default name for team.">
    <input type="submit" value="OK">
</form>
```

## Django form handling process
Django's form handling uses all of the same techniques that we learned about in previous tutorials (for displaying information about our models): the view gets a request, performs any actions required including reading data from the models, then generates and returns an HTML page (from a template, into which we pass a context containing the data to be displayed). What makes things more complicated is that the server also needs to be able to process data provided by the user, and redisplay the page if there are any errors.

A process flowchart of how Django handles form requests is shown below, starting with a request for a page containing a form (shown in green).

**Based on the diagram above, the main things that Django's form handling does are:**

1. Display the default form the first time it is requested by the user.

2. Receive data from a submit request and bind it to the form

3. Clean and validate the data.

4. f any data is invalid, re-display the form, this time with any user populated values and error messages for the problem fields.

5. If all data is valid, perform required actions (e.g. save the data, send an email, return the result of a search, upload a file, etc.)

6. Once all actions are complete, redirect the user to another page.


### Declaring a Form

>`from django import forms`
`class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):`
    `renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")`
